Crime is a major social challenge in India, and understanding crime patterns can help policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and citizens improve safety and security. This project focuses on mapping crime hotspots across India and predicting potential crime-prone areas using Machine Learning and Geospatial Analysis. The indian_crime.py script is a complete workflow for analyzing and visualizing crime data in India. It begins with data cleaning (handling missing values, formatting dates, filling unknown weapon types), followed by feature extraction such as year, month, day, and time of occurrence. The script then performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using plots to show crime trends over years, top cities, major crime types, gender distribution of victims, weapon usage, and case closure status. It also integrates geospatial analysis by using the geopy library to geocode Indian cities and folium to create an interactive crime hotspot map. The final outputs include cleaned datasets, statistical insights, and a crime mapping dashboard (HTML map) for hotspot visualization.
